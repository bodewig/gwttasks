When GWT was introduced in 2006 I played with it for a day or two and
hacked together a few macrodefs over Ant's java task that I then
published as GWT Antlib.

After that I have never really used it at all - neither the Antlib nor
GWT, but somehow the Antlib ended up in some documentations as
recommended integration between Ant and GWT and so I ended up getting
support requests.  I don't really support this Antlib, feel free to
fork it if it still is of any use.

Binaries can be found at <http://stefan.samaflost.de/code/gwttasks/>.
The closest thing to documentation is

together with a tiny update three years later in
<http://stefan.samaflost.de/blog/en/Java/GWT/gwttasks_0.2.html>.
